# Welcome message before we get input from customer

# Retrieve number of feet of fiber optic cable
# Validate so only numeric input is accepted

# Define cost per foot
# Added constant file for cost per foot and declared after validation for better memory management
COST_PER_FOOT = 0.95

# Calculate total installation cost
total_cost = feet_requested * COST_PER_FOOT

# Print a formatted receipt
